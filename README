To install (On Ubuntu):

	Setup PIP:
		sudo apt-get install pip

	Setup Lettuce:
		sudo -E pip install lettuce
		sudo -E C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/mpi pip install netcdf4

Layout:
	Within this repository, each core gets it's own directory, with it's own
	feature and task definitions. The task directory contains shared tasks 
	that all cores should be able to use.
	
	Task files from the root of the features directory should be symlinked 
	into each of the component directories.

To use:
	You can edit the lettuce.config script to point to two separate
	repositories and branches on each repository. Once the config file is 
	setup properly, lettuce can be run as in `lettuce features/ocean` test 
	all of the pre-defined features the ocean should have.

	Both repositories and branches are cloned and build separately. Test 
	cases for each version are downloaded separately as well.

	Tests are run in separate directories for each version of the 
	repository, and compared (if required by a scenario in defined in the 
	features).
